module Wordnik

  # the simple idea here of a load balancer is to keep a set of hosts
  # around, and use the 'best' one. At Wordnik, we have a set of
  # API hosts available to us (these servers are invisible to the general web)
  # The class below implements three strategies â€” least recently used,
  # random, and least frequently used.
  #
  # The Wordnik Configuration object will convert a :hosts specification
  # into LoadBalancer (which defaults to LRU)
  #
  # You can also specify an instance of RandomLoadBalancer or LeastFrequentlyUsedLoadBalancer
  # if you choose, or be picky and specify LeastRecentlyUsedLoadBalancer
  #
  # These should be thread safe.
